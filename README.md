# Python Package for Geodetic Data Plotting
This is a collection of Pyhton scripts written during my PhD study. Mostly, these are some plotting scripts for visualizing results from geodetic data processing, e.g., GNSS, SLR and Inter-Satellite-Links (ISL). However, some general aspects of the geodetic data presentation are also or will be covered! Currently, the following categories are grossly summarized as different sub-directories.
